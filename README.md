# PatrolFund: Decentralized Community Patrol Funding

## Overview

PatrolFund is a Web3 project built on the Stacks blockchain using Clarity smart contracts. It enables communities to crowdfund security patrols in underserved or high-risk areas through transparent donations. Donors contribute STX (Stacks' native token) or other supported tokens, which are pooled and distributed to verified patrollers based on community proposals and votes. This solves real-world problems like inadequate public safety in low-income neighborhoods, refugee camps, or areas with delayed emergency responses by providing a decentralized, tamper-proof system for funding and verifying patrols.

### Key Features
- **Transparent Donations**: All contributions are tracked on-chain, ensuring donors can see how funds are used.
- **Community Governance**: Users propose patrols, vote on them, and verify completion.
- **Incentive Mechanism**: Patrollers earn rewards upon successful verification, encouraging participation.
- **Real-World Impact**: Integrates with off-chain verification (e.g., via community reports or simple oracles) to confirm patrol activities, addressing security gaps in real communities.
- **Tokenomics**: Includes a governance token (PFT) for voting and staking.

The project involves 6 core smart contracts written in Clarity, ensuring security, clarity (pun intended), and auditability. Clarity's decidable nature prevents common bugs like reentrancy.

## Problem Solved

In many regions, traditional policing is underfunded or ineffective due to corruption, bureaucracy, or resource shortages. PatrolFund decentralizes funding for community-led patrols, allowing donations from global supporters to directly support local security efforts. This reduces crime rates, builds trust, and empowers communitiesâ€”real-world examples include neighborhood watches in urban areas or border patrols in conflict zones.

## Architecture

The system works as follows:
1. Donors send funds to a donation pool.
2. Community members propose patrols (e.g., "Patrol downtown area for 4 hours").
3. Token holders vote on proposals via the DAO.
4. Approved proposals lock funds in escrow.
5. Patrollers complete tasks and submit proof (verified on-chain via multisig or simple oracle).
6. Funds are released upon verification.
7. Governance token holders can stake for rewards and influence decisions.

## Smart Contracts

Below are the 6 core Clarity smart contracts. Each is designed to be modular, composable, and secure. Full code is provided for clarity (deploy them on Stacks testnet/mainnet using the Clarity CLI).

### 1. DonationPool.clar
Handles receiving and pooling donations.

```clarity
;; DonationPool Contract
(define-trait token-trait
  ((transfer (principal uint) (response bool uint))))

(define-data-var total-donations uint u0)
(define-map donations principal uint)

(define-public (donate (amount uint) (token <token-trait>))
  (begin
    (try! (contract-call? token transfer tx-sender amount))
    (map-set donations tx-sender (+ (default-to u0 (map-get? donations tx-sender)) amount))
    (var-set total-donations (+ (var-get total-donations) amount))
    (ok true)))

(define-read-only (get-total-donations)
  (ok (var-get total-donations)))

(define-read-only (get-donation (donor principal))
  (ok (default-to u0 (map-get? donations donor))))
```

### 2. PatrolProposal.clar
Manages creation and storage of patrol proposals.

```clarity
;; PatrolProposal Contract
(define-data-var proposal-counter uint u0)
(define-map proposals uint { proposer: principal, description: (string-ascii 256), duration: uint, required-funds: uint, status: (string-ascii 20) })

(define-public (create-proposal (description (string-ascii 256)) (duration uint) (required-funds uint))
  (let ((proposal-id (+ (var-get proposal-counter) u1)))
    (map-set proposals proposal-id { proposer: tx-sender, description: description, duration: duration, required-funds: required-funds, status: "pending" })
    (var-set proposal-counter proposal-id)
    (ok proposal-id)))

(define-read-only (get-proposal (id uint))
  (map-get? proposals id))

(define-public (update-status (id uint) (new-status (string-ascii 20)))
  (match (map-get? proposals id)
    some-proposal (if (is-eq (get proposer some-proposal) tx-sender)
                    (begin
                      (map-set proposals id (merge some-proposal { status: new-status }))
                      (ok true))
                    (err u403)) ;; Forbidden
    (err u404))) ;; Not found
```

### 3. GovernanceDAO.clar
DAO for voting on proposals using governance tokens.

```clarity
;; GovernanceDAO Contract
(use-trait token-trait .DonationPool.token-trait) ;; Assuming PFT token implements this

(define-data-var voting-period uint u144) ;; ~1 day in blocks
(define-map votes uint { proposal-id: uint, yes: uint, no: uint, end-block: uint })

(define-public (vote (proposal-id uint) (vote-yes bool) (amount uint) (token <token-trait>))
  (let ((current-vote (default-to { yes: u0, no: u0, end-block: u0 } (map-get? votes proposal-id))))
    (try! (contract-call? token transfer tx-sender amount)) ;; Stake tokens to vote
    (if vote-yes
      (map-set votes proposal-id (merge current-vote { yes: (+ (get yes current-vote) amount), end-block: (+ block-height (var-get voting-period)) }))
      (map-set votes proposal-id (merge current-vote { no: (+ (get no current-vote) amount), end-block: (+ block-height (var-get voting-period)) })))
    (ok true)))

(define-read-only (get-vote-result (proposal-id uint))
  (let ((vote (map-get? votes proposal-id)))
    (match vote
      some-vote (if (> (get yes some-vote) (get no some-vote)) (ok "approved") (ok "rejected"))
      (err u404))))

(define-public (end-vote (proposal-id uint))
  (if (>= block-height (get end-block (default-to { end-block: u0 } (map-get? votes proposal-id))))
    (ok (unwrap! (get-vote-result proposal-id) (err u500)))
    (err u401))) ;; Not ended
```

### 4. FundEscrow.clar
Escrows funds for approved proposals until verification.

```clarity
;; FundEscrow Contract
(use-trait token-trait .DonationPool.token-trait)

(define-map escrows uint { proposal-id: uint, amount: uint, patroller: principal, released: bool })

(define-public (lock-funds (proposal-id uint) (amount uint) (patroller principal) (token <token-trait>))
  (begin
    (try! (contract-call? token transfer tx-sender amount))
    (map-set escrows proposal-id { proposal-id: proposal-id, amount: amount, patroller: patroller, released: false })
    (ok true)))

(define-public (release-funds (proposal-id uint) (token <token-trait>))
  (match (map-get? escrows proposal-id)
    some-escrow (if (not (get released some-escrow))
                  (begin
                    (try! (as-contract (contract-call? token transfer (get patroller some-escrow) (get amount some-escrow))))
                    (map-set escrows proposal-id (merge some-escrow { released: true }))
                    (ok true))
                  (err u409)) ;; Already released
    (err u404)))
```

### 5. VerificationOracle.clar
Simple multisig-based oracle for verifying patrol completion (e.g., 3/5 community signers).

```clarity
;; VerificationOracle Contract
(define-data-var required-signatures uint u3)
(define-map verifications uint { proposal-id: uint, signatures: (list 10 principal), verified: bool })

(define-public (sign-verification (proposal-id uint))
  (let ((current (default-to { signatures: (list), verified: false } (map-get? verifications proposal-id))))
    (map-set verifications proposal-id (merge current { signatures: (append (get signatures current) tx-sender) }))
    (if (>= (len (get signatures current)) (var-get required-signatures))
      (map-set verifications proposal-id (merge current { verified: true }))
      false)
    (ok true)))

(define-read-only (is-verified (proposal-id uint))
  (ok (get verified (default-to { verified: false } (map-get? verifications proposal-id)))))
```

### 6. GovernanceToken.clar (PFT Token)
Fungible token for governance and staking.

```clarity
;; GovernanceToken Contract (SIP-010 compliant)
(define-fungible-token pft u1000000000) ;; 1B supply

(define-public (transfer (recipient principal) (amount uint))
  (ft-transfer? pft amount tx-sender recipient))

(define-public (mint (recipient principal) (amount uint))
  (if (is-eq tx-sender contract-caller) ;; Only callable by DAO or admin
    (ft-mint? pft amount recipient)
    (err u403)))

(define-read-only (get-balance (account principal))
  (ok (ft-get-balance? pft account)))

(define-read-only (get-total-supply)
  (ok (ft-get-supply? pft)))
```

## Installation

1. Install Clarity CLI: Follow Stacks docs at https://docs.stacks.co/clarity.
2. Clone the repo: `git clone <repo-url>`.
3. Deploy contracts: Use `clarinet deploy` for local testing or deploy to testnet via Hiro's tools.
4. Frontend: Build a simple dApp with React/Leather wallet for interactions (not included here).

## Usage

- Deploy all contracts in order (DonationPool first).
- Donate via `donate` function.
- Create proposals, vote, verify, and release funds.
- Integrate with a frontend for user-friendly interface.

## Security Notes

- All contracts use `try!` for error handling.
- No external calls to prevent reentrancy (Clarity's strength).
- Audit recommended before mainnet deployment.
